       "RunResponse(content=\"<understanding>\\nThe requirement ID 245114 pertains to the power consumption limits of the Steering ECU. Specifically, it states that the ECU must have a maximum power consumption of 50W during peak load conditions (e.g., full steering assist torque at low vehicle speeds) and no more than 20W during normal operation. Additionally, it requires the ECU to trigger a DTC_OverCurrent if power consumption exceeds 50W for more than 1 second under normal conditions. The DTC should clear once the fault is resolved.\\n\\nTo ensure complete understanding, I have a few clarifying questions:\\n\\n1. Are there specific operating conditions or scenarios that should be prioritized for testing beyond what is explicitly mentioned?\\n2. Should the test scenarios also verify the ECU's behavior when transitioning between peak and normal load conditions?\\n3. Are there any additional fault conditions or edge cases related to power consumption that need to be addressed?\\n\\n</understanding>\\n\\n<test_scenarios>\\n### Test Scenarios for Requirement 245114\\n\\n#### 1. **Peak Load Power Consumption Test**\\n   - **Purpose:** Verify that the ECU's power consumption does not exceed 50W during peak load conditions.\\n   - **Setup:** Simulate full steering assist torque at low vehicle speeds.\\n   - **Steps:**\\n     1. Apply maximum steering torque input (e.g., 10Nm).\\n     2. Measure the power consumption of the ECU.\\n   - **Expected Result:** Power consumption should not exceed 50W.\\n\\n#### 2. **Normal Operation Power Consumption Test**\\n   - **Purpose:** Verify that the ECU's power consumption does not exceed 20W during normal operation.\\n   - **Setup:** Simulate typical driving conditions (e.g., moderate steering input at medium vehicle speeds).\\n   - **Steps:**\\n     1. Apply a moderate steering torque input (e.g., 2Nm).\\n     2. Measure the power consumption of the ECU.\\n   - **Expected Result:** Power consumption should not exceed 20W.\\n\\n#### 3. **DTC_OverCurrent Triggering Test**\\n   - **Purpose:** Verify that the DTC_OverCurrent is triggered when power consumption exceeds 50W for more than 1 second.\\n   - **Setup:** Simulate a scenario where power consumption exceeds 50W (e.g., by inducing an artificial high current draw).\\n   - **Steps:**\\n     1. Increase the power consumption of the ECU beyond 50W.\\n     2. Monitor the DTC status.\\n   - **Expected Result:** The DTC_OverCurrent should be triggered within 1 second of exceeding the power limit.\\n\\n#### 4. **DTC_OverCurrent Clearing Test**\\n   - **Purpose:** Verify that the DTC_OverCurrent clears from the ECU's fault memory once the fault condition is resolved.\\n   - **Setup:** After triggering the DTC_OverCurrent, restore normal operating conditions.\\n   - **Steps:**\\n     1. Reduce the power consumption to below 50W.\\n     2. Monitor the DTC status.\\n   - **Expected Result:** The DTC_OverCurrent should clear from the fault memory.\\n\\n#### 5. **Power Consumption Under Varying Load Conditions**\\n   - **Purpose:** Verify that the ECU's power consumption remains within limits under varying load conditions.\\n   - **Setup:** Simulate transitions between low-speed and high-speed driving scenarios.\\n   - **Steps:**\\n     1. Transition from low-speed to high-speed driving.\\n     2. Measure the power consumption during the transition.\\n   - **Expected Result:** Power consumption should remain within the specified limits during the transition.\\n\\n#### 6. **Worst-Case Power Consumption Test**\\n   - **Purpose:** Verify that the ECU's power consumption remains within limits under worst-case scenarios (e.g., high ambient temperature, maximum steering assist, etc.).\\n   - **Setup:** Simulate worst-case operating conditions (e.g., high ambient temperature, maximum steering torque, and low vehicle speed).\\n   - **Steps:**\\n     1. Apply maximum steering torque input.\\n     2. Measure the power consumption of the ECU.\\n   - **Expected Result:** Power consumption should not exceed 50W.\\n\\n</test_scenarios>\", content_type='str', event='RunResponse', messages=[Message(role='system', content=\"You are an AI assisant who will help understanding the requirements of automotive Electronic Circuit Units (ECU) and generate test scenarios to validate them\\n\\n<instructions>\\nProvide the response in below format. \\n<understanding>\\nExplain your understanding and ask questions / clarification required for understanding complete requirement, if you have any doubts don't do assumptions.\\n\\n</understanding>\\n\\n<test_sceanrios>\\nTest scenarios to validate the requirement.\\n</test_scenarios>\\n\\n</instructions>\\n\\n<additional_information>\\n- Use markdown to format your answers.\\n</additional_information>\", name=None, tool_call_id=None, tool_calls=None, audio=None, images=None, videos=None, audio_output=None, reasoning_content=None, tool_name=None, tool_args=None, tool_call_error=None, stop_after_tool_call=False, add_to_agent_memory=True, metrics={}, references=None, created_at=1739287243), Message(role='user', content=' For 245114 requirement, perform the below tasks.\\n- First understand the requirement completely based on provided knowledge base and Explain your understanding and thoughts.

      "#### 3. **DTC_OverCurrent Triggering Test**\n",
      "   - **Purpose:** Verify that the DTC_OverCurrent is triggered when power consumption exceeds 50W for more than 1 second.\n",
      "   - **Setup:** Simulate a scenario where power consumption exceeds 50W (e.g., by inducing an artificial high current draw).\n",
      "   - **Steps:**\n",
      "     1. Increase the power consumption of the ECU beyond 50W.\n",
      "     2. Monitor the DTC status.\n",
      "   - **Expected Result:** The DTC_OverCurrent should be triggered within 1 second of exceeding the power limit.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. **DTC_OverCurrent Clearing Test**\n",
      "   - **Purpose:** Verify that the DTC_OverCurrent clears from the ECU's fault memory once the fault condition is resolved.\n",
      "   - **Setup:** After triggering the DTC_OverCurrent, restore normal operating conditions.\n",
      "   - **Steps:**\n",
      "     1. Reduce the power consumption to below 50W.\n",
      "     2. Monitor the DTC status.\n",
      "   - **Expected Result:** The DTC_OverCurrent should clear from the fault memory.\n",

      "#### 5. **Power Consumption Under Varying Load Conditions**\n",
      "   - **Purpose:** Verify that the ECU's power consumption remains within limits under varying load conditions.\n",
      "   - **Setup:** Simulate transitions between low-speed and high-speed driving scenarios.\n",
      "   - **Steps:**\n",
      "     1. Transition from low-speed to high-speed driving.\n",
      "     2. Measure the power consumption during the transition.\n",
      "   - **Expected Result:** Power consumption should remain within the specified limits during the transition.\n",

      "#### 6. **Worst-Case Power Consumption Test**\n",
      "   - **Purpose:** Verify that the ECU's power consumption remains within limits under worst-case scenarios (e.g., high ambient temperature, maximum steering assist, etc.).\n",
      "   - **Setup:** Simulate worst-case operating conditions (e.g., high ambient temperature, maximum steering torque, and low vehicle speed).\n",
      "   - **Steps:**\n",
      "     1. Apply maximum steering torque input.\n",
      "     2. Measure the power consumption of the ECU.\n",
      "   - **Expected Result:** Power consumption should not exceed 50W.\n",
